# Introducing Jekyll RDF

by Natanael Arndt from the German National Library

> We'll introduce Jekyll RDF, a plugin for the open-source static website generator Jekyll. It allows the use of RDF data, such as SKOS Taxonomies and OWL Ontologies, in the static websites generated with Jekyll. If you are looking for a fast, lightweight and open-source taxonomy publication system, this event may be for you.
